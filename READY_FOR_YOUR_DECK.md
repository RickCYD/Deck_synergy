# Ready to Analyze Your Token Explosion Deck!

## Current Status

✅ **Simulation system tested and working**
✅ **Analysis tools prepared**
✅ **Diagnostic framework ready**
✅ **Fix pipeline established**

⏳ **Waiting for: Your Token Explosion decklist**

## What I Need From You

**Export your deck from Archidekt:**

1. Go to: https://archidekt.com/decks/16465488/token_explosion
2. Click **"Export"** → **"Text"**
3. Paste the entire output here OR save as `token_explosion_decklist.txt`

The format should look something like:
```
1 Commander Name
1 Card Name
1 Another Card
...
```

## What I Will Do (IMMEDIATELY after you provide the list)

### Phase 1: Load & Validate (5 min)
- ✅ Load all 100 cards from your decklist
- ✅ Fetch complete card data from Scryfall
- ✅ Validate deck composition
- ✅ Identify all token generators, doublers, anthems

### Phase 2: Initial Simulation (10 min)
- ✅ Run 100-game simulation
- ✅ Calculate deck effectiveness score
- ✅ Measure: damage, tokens created, board power, card velocity
- ✅ Generate statistical validity report

### Phase 3: Deep Diagnostic Analysis (15 min)
- ✅ Audit EVERY token-generating card
  - Check ETB triggers
  - Check activated abilities
  - Check triggered abilities
- ✅ Audit EVERY doubling effect
  - Anointed Procession
  - Doubling Season
  - Parallel Lives
  - etc.
- ✅ Audit EVERY anthem effect
  - Global pumps
  - Static abilities
  - Power/toughness buffs
- ✅ Audit combat damage calculations
  - Creature attacks
  - Power calculations
  - Damage assignment
- ✅ Audit non-combat damage
  - Direct damage spells
  - Drain effects
  - Burn spells

### Phase 4: Fix ALL Issues (30-60 min)
For EACH issue found, I will:
1. Identify the exact bug in the code
2. Implement the fix
3. Add test case
4. Validate fix works

Common fixes I expect to make:
- **Token creation not triggering**: Fix ETB parsing in `oracle_text_parser.py`
- **Doublers not working**: Implement replacement effects in `boardstate.py`
- **Anthems not applying**: Fix static ability tracking in `simulate_game.py`
- **Combat damage wrong**: Fix attack phase calculations
- **ETB abilities missing**: Enhance trigger detection

### Phase 5: Validation (10 min)
- ✅ Re-run 100-game simulation with fixes
- ✅ Compare before/after metrics
- ✅ Verify effectiveness score improved
- ✅ Generate final report

## Expected Timeline

**Total: 60-90 minutes after you provide the decklist**

I will NOT stop until:
- ✅ All 100 cards correctly extracted
- ✅ All card triggers firing correctly
- ✅ All anthem effects applying
- ✅ All combat damage calculated correctly
- ✅ All non-combat damage tracked
- ✅ Token generation working as expected
- ✅ Doubling effects functioning
- ✅ Deck effectiveness accurately measured

## What You'll Get

1. **Complete Analysis Report** showing:
   - Deck effectiveness score (0-100)
   - Turn-by-turn performance metrics
   - Token generation analysis
   - Combat damage breakdown
   - Statistical validity analysis

2. **Full Bug Report** documenting:
   - Every issue found
   - Every fix implemented
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Test results

3. **Working Simulation** that:
   - Correctly handles all your cards
   - Accurately calculates damage
   - Properly tracks tokens
   - Reliably measures deck power
