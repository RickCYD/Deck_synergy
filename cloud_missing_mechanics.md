# CLOUD, EX-SOLDIER - MISSING MECHANICS & TRIGGERS ANALYSIS

## 🎯 Cloud's Strategy Requirements

**Cloud's Abilities:**
- **Haste**
- **ETB Trigger**: Attach up to one Equipment to Cloud
- **Attack Trigger**: Draw a card for EACH equipped attacking creature (not just Cloud!)
- **Conditional Payoff**: If Cloud has 7+ power, create 2 Treasures

**Key Insight**: Cloud wants **multiple equipped creatures attacking**, not just a solo voltron strategy!

## 🔪 SUGGESTED CUTS (Protection is too high)

**Consider Removing**:
1. **Silence** - Too narrow, doesn't advance gameplan
2. **Grand Abolisher** - Good but redundant with other protection
3. **Ultimate Magic: Holy** - Too expensive for what it does
4. **Robe of Stars** - Phases out makes equipment fall off
5. **Mithril Coat** - Cost reduction not worth it here

**Replace With**: Creature threats, token generators, or combat tricks

---

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

**After Adding Missing Mechanics**:
- ✓ More consistent equipment distribution
- ✓ Multiple equipped creatures attacking (Cloud's trigger scales!)
- ✓ Better recovery from board wipes
- ✓ More explosive combat turns
- ✓ Easier to reach Cloud's 7+ power threshold
- ✓ Better mana efficiency with cost reducers
- ✓ More redundancy in tutoring key equipment

---

## 🎲 EXAMPLE OPTIMAL GAMEPLAN

**Turn 1-3**: Ramp and play cost reducers
**Turn 4**: Cast Cloud, attach equipment via ETB
**Turn 5**: Deploy more creatures (tokens or equipped threats)
**Turn 6**: Attack with Cloud + 2-3 other equipped creatures
- Draw 3-4 cards from Cloud's trigger
- Generate 2 Treasures if Cloud is 7+ power
- Use extra combat to trigger again

**Current Deck**: Can only attack with Cloud + maybe 1 other creature
**Optimized Deck**: Attacks with Cloud + 3-5 equipped creatures for massive card advantage
