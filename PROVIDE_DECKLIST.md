# Token Explosion Deck Analysis - Decklist Needed

Due to API access restrictions, I need you to provide your decklist.

## How to Export from Archidekt

1. Visit: https://archidekt.com/decks/16465488/token_explosion
2. Click **"Export"** button
3. Select **"Text"** format
4. Copy the output

## Required Format

Simple text format, one card per line. The commander should be marked or listed first:

```
Commander: Jetmir, Nexus of Revels

1 Avenger of Zendikar
1 Doubling Season
1 Anointed Procession
... (rest of cards)
```

Or just paste the raw Archidekt export - I can parse various formats.

## Once You Provide It

I will:
1. ✅ Load all 100 cards (99 + commander)
2. ✅ Validate all cards are correctly extracted
3. ✅ Run 100+ game simulation
4. ✅ Analyze token generation triggers
5. ✅ Audit anthem/buff effects
6. ✅ Audit combat and non-combat damage
7. ✅ Identify and FIX all issues
8. ✅ Re-run and validate effectiveness score

## What I'll Fix

- Token creation triggers not firing
- Doubling effects not applying
- Anthem effects not buffing creatures
- Combat damage miscalculations
- ETB triggers missing
- Any other mechanical issues

**Please provide your decklist and I'll immediately begin the full analysis and fixes!**
